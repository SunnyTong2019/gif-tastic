* When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API related to the topic of the button and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

* Users can enter a new topic which will add a new button.
